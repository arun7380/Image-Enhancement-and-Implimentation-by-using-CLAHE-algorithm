The project is "Image Enhancement & Implementation using CLAHE Algorithm" and deals with the enhancement of quality of digital images which are degraded by noise or poor illumination conditions. In this study, several image enhancement techniques have been discussed. However, CLAHE is mainly highlighted, and some other techniques such as bilinear interpolation, gamma correction, and adaptive histogram equalization are also discussed.

 Main Goals:
1. Noise Reduction: Remove sensor noise and electronic interference in real-time image sequences.
2. Contrast Augmentation: Improve view, thus enhancing perception, thus enhancing analysis.
 3. Edge Detection and Sharpening: Enhance views applying filters and bandpass algorithms.

 Method:
 
CLAHE Algorithm:- Increasing contrast locally without amplification noise  
Gamma Correction:- Contrasts in Gamma-correcting brightness  
Median filtering :- Filters out impulse noise completely  
Edge Enhancement:- Gaussian Laplace filter  
Color Transformations:- Enhancements, transformations that occur in Y ' CbCr and also, HSV color space    

 Results:
These techniques were tested on different images, and it was observed that noise reduction, contrast, and detail visibility were improved. CLAHE algorithm had the most promising results with the balanced and high-quality outcome, especially for grayscale and color images.
